1.	How do I approach designing software? 

There is a saying that I learned years ago from the CEO at work. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. It took me a few weeks to really start to understand the cods and what it does. Once I learn that I was able to add stuff each week so when it was due I only had a few things to do.

2.	How do I approach developing programs? 

When I developed the project, I started by having one object at origin. My code was a cobbled-up mess. As I learned what each part of code does, I was able to refine it is down to organized readable code. Although it was daunting the was time, I have to complete break everything apart the put it back together. You just cannot be afraid to step back to move forward.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
 
One of my careers paths is in game or graphics area of the computer science. One of the main reasons of going back to school is to get into a field that I love. I already have a good job so I can take my time to find something that I enjoy. It is not work if you love it. While this class taught me much, I know I barely scratch the surface. I want to take what I learned and further that knowledge but taking different classes or just reading an article online. The day you close yourself and think you know everything is the day you fail.
